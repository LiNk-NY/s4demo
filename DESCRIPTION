Description: The package demonstrates the creation of an S4 class along with
    its constructor, accessor, and replacement functions / methods. The
    FooRanges class inherits from GRanges and adds a "barbar" slot. The accessor
    and replacement functions for the "barbar" slot are defined in the package.
    The 'foobar' method gives a summary of the object and the 'show' method
    is inherited from 'GRanges'.
